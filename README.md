# Get plant area index from LiDAR

Plant area index (PAI) plays a dominant role in the reflectance characteristics of vegetated surfaces, and is an important factor that relates to photosynthetic and respiration activities. LiDAR is an active optical sensing technique that can be used to estimate the forest structure parameters such as PAI, Leaf inclination distributions, leaf clumping, or canopy directional gap fraction distribution. This code reprository provides a list of tools for use with airborne LiDAR point cloud data to quantify the vertical stratification of the plant canopies.
